# 2024 Robot Tour Source Code

## About
<p>The 2024 Robot Tour event challenged teams to create a robot which could navigate through a maze, and end on a target pointat a specified time. The robot could not be controlled during a run, so the path needed to be pre-programmed prior to a starting.Additionally, there were certain optional "Bonus Squares" which would give a team additional points if the robot could gotthrough it on it's path to the target.</p>
<p>I made this robot and it competed and placed well in competitions for the first half of the season, and it was programmed in
python. The final bot was done using Arduino setup with an Al image-recognition to locate the target point, and coded in C++.</p>

## Final* Components
